# Thingspeak Charting Utility.

This is an app for charting data from a private ThingSpeak channel. It requires the readAPI for the channel. The app displays a chart of the data and also offers a link for downloading the data.

It was created to support the Wely project, and as a portfolio example to demonstrate coding abilities for front end web development.
